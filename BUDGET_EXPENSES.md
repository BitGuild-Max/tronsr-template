Here youâ€™ll find a detailed outline of our planned budget expenses relating to TRON Super Representative status:

- $60,000/year for technical infrastructure (fullnode, secondary, backup server, & room for expansion)
- $100,000/year for community initiatives - We strive to offer incentives to help spread the word about TRON, BitGuild, blockchain, and cryptocurrency in general in the form of airdrops, on-site events, game item giveaways, fan meetups, etc.
- All operational costs will be covered by the BitGuild foundation.
